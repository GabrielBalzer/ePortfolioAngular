# Installation
## Node.js
Make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.

Angular requires a current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. See the engines key for the specific version requirements in our package.json.

To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

To get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Angular CLI
### Install the Angular CLI
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli
